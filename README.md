# Hallucination-Detection
The Hallucination Detection Classifier identifies whether summaries are factual or hallucinated using logistic regression built from scratch. It leverages the XSum Hallucination Dataset, focusing on text preprocessing, robust evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score), k-fold cross-validation, and error analysis.
